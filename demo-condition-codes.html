        <h1>Condition Codes</h1>
        <p>We strive t0 sell only the highest quality parts, but we also realize that it is unrealistic for us to be experts in all airframes or knowledgeable of every requirement for every part we sell. Zenith Aviation is not an FAA Authorized Repair Station, so we are unable to determine the airworthiness or serviceability of a part, regardless of its stated condition. According to the FAA, ultimate responsibility to determine serviceability or airworthiness of a part rests with the maintenance technician pror to the part being installed on an aircraft. Many of our parts are purchased in bulk-lots from airlines and corporate operators, and although we do a quality check of each part and its accompanying certification paperwork at the time that parts are received, occasionally a certified part may have a re-certification requirement or shelf life that is not communicated on either the part or said paperwork. We make very effort to accurately list parts and their conditions as represented in the certification documents that accompany the part.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, we are proud to work with the best subject matter experts in the industry - our clients! We rely on you to communicate any special requirements to us in advance, to preclude any possible surprises once a part arrives at your location. We are happy to provide copies of any and all paperwork that you may request in advance of your placing an order. If, after reviewing the paperwork, the part does not meet your requirements, alternate parts or serial numbers may be available for you to review. Our friendly, professional sales staff is eager to make you get the right part at the best possible price!</p>
        <p>To help you wiht your parts selection, below is a list of Part Conditions used by Zenith Aviation. Please refer to this list when considering a purchase from Zenith. It is important to note that, because of our business model, Zenith guarantees taht parts will work when first installed on the aircraft, but no warranties, implied or otherwise, are offered.</p>
      </article>
      <div class="code-list">
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li>
            <h3>New (NE)</h3>
            <p>A component part or material produced in conformity with approved data that is accompanied by a manufacturer's material certification at the time of sale and has no operating time or cycles.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Overhauled (OH)</h3>
            <p>A used component or part which has been overhauled using methods, techniques, and practices acceptable to the FAA and has been disassembled, cleaned, inspected, repaired as necessary, and reassembled. In addition, it has been tested in accordance with approved standards and technical data acceptable to the FAA.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Rebuilt (RB)</h3>
            <p>A component that has been rebuilt to original tolerances. These parts are generally taken in on exchange, rebuilt completely under PMA, and are considered like "New". Generally, rebuilt components will be accompanied by an FAA Form 8130-3, and vendor PMA number will be referenced, when applicable, on the airworthiness certification document.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Repaired (RP)</h3>
            <p>A component or part which has been restored to a serviceable condition in conformity with data acceptable to the FAA.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Modified (MO)</h3>
            <p>A component or part which has been altered in conformity with approved data.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Tested (TST)</h3>
            <p>A material, component or part which has been examined by means of test procedures to establish conformity with acceptable data.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Inspected (IN)</h3>
            <p>A material, component or part which has been examined by means of visual or test procedures to establish conformity with acceptable data. Generally, this class of part is inspected and tested with No Fault Found(NFF). Zenith Aviation is NOT a repair station or certified to conduct inspections or repairs, but will provide test data if provided to us by a certified repair facility. When no inspection data is provided to us, we will provide only the airworthiness certificate that has been provided to us.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>New Surplus (NS)</h3>
            <p>A component part or material that is unused and may have been released as surplus by the manufacturer, owner-operator, repair facility, etc. New Surplus parts from Zenith will NOT be delivered with certification paperwork (such as an OEM C of C or an airworthiness certificate), but MAY have an OEM or repair station tag (most often, but not always, with an inspection stamp), or the part may be sealed in original OEM packaging. All new surplus parts from our stock will have a Zenith Aviation CofC and trace document to our source.</p>
            <p>If you are considering an NS part purchase, please speak with the salesperson about your trace and/or certification requirements BEFORE sending a purchase order.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Received as new (RAN)</h3>
            <p>This is a condition code that was created by Zenith Aviation in an effort to best describe a part that would be otherwise difficult to classify using industry best-practices. Our business model involves buying parts, in bulk from airlines, corporate operators, repair stations, etc, when a seller upgrades or downsizes it's fleet, and they no longer need the parts for a particular platform. RECEIVED AS NEW (RAN) are those CONSUMABLE parts that came to us by way of a bulk purchase, that were reported to us at the time of purchase as being new, but did not arrive with certification or airworthiness documents, or in OEM packaging. We have come to learn that not all operators retain certification paperwork with their parts, as it is our practice to do here at Zenith Aviation, but we also know that most airlines will trust the quality systems of other airlines, operators and rep air stations. Zenith lists these parts as RAN because this is the most accurate description we can thing of, but we do so only after a thorough inbound quality inspection by our team reveals that they are new in everyway by physical appearance. Received As New parts will only be accompanied by a Zenith C of C and trace to our source - no other document was provided to us by the seller, so we have nothing else to pass on.</p>
            <p>If you are considering a RAN part purchase, please speak with the salesperson about your trace and/or certification requirements BEFORE sending a purchase order.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Serviceable (SV)</h3>
            <p>With the exception of "AR" parts, everything we sell is in "Serviceable" condition. This is an FAA term that means that the material, part or component meets the manufacturer's performance specifications, although a more accurate condition code could be used (such as Repaired, Overhauled, etc.). "SV" is a code that Zenith used in our previous inventory tracking system, and we are working diligently to more accurately identify and classify our inventory to reflect one of the conditions listed above. All "SV" parts are legally approved for installation and use but please inquire of your salesman if you need more information about a part or its airworthiness certification documents.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>As Removed (AR)</h3>
        <p>Parts that have no Release Certificate and are not certified for installation. AR parts will require AT LEAST testing/inspection, and possible repairs or modification to recertify prior to use. AR is not authoritatively defined within the industry, but Zenith Aviation defines this class of part as simply having been removed from a Next Higher Assembly (NHA). That NHA could be an aircraft, engine, or an assembly. Zenith makes bulk purchases of parts when airlines and/or corporate operators sell aircraft or close their doors, and as such can provide trace documents to that seller, but we are often able to provide NHA data or documentation to support it.</p>
        <p>At Zenith Aviation, AR parts fall under 1 of 3 possible categories:</p>
        <p>1. A component, part or material, the condition of which cannot certainly and accurately be classified and therefore its status is unknown. No guarantee is expressed or implied about the repairability of the part.</p>
        <p>2. A component, part or material that was removed from an NHA and tagged by an operator with a suspected squawk, but the part has not been evaluated by a certified repair station to confirm the squawk.</p>
        <p>3. Occasionally we send an AR part from our stock to a repair station for evaluation but do not complete the repair. If no sale is pending, or if the evaluation receals a higher-than average repair cost we may decide to have the part returned to us in "as-is" condition until a need arises to have the part repaired. Under this category, the parts are evaluated and are found to be repairable, but no business need existed at the time of the evaluation for us to proceed with the repair. It is the buyer's responsibility to make sure the part they order meets their need prior to commiting to the purchase. We can provide a full disclosure only when we understand your requirements, so please ask! We list these parts as AR even though we know the condition of the part.</p>
        <p>Warning to purchasers!! AR parts are NOT compliant wiht FAA airworthiness requirements. Buyers are solely responsible for bringing the parts into compliance wiht 14 CFR part 21 or other applicable standards, by obtaining all necessary FAA inspections or modifications. If you are considering an AR part purchase, please speak with the salesperson about your trace requirements BEFORE sending a purchase order. To restate, NO guarantee is expressed or implied about the repairability or condition of our AR stock, and AR parts are sold "as-is, where-is".</p>

        <h1>Traceability: What Does It Mean?</h1>
        <p>"The Parts Traceability Puzzle" is an article written up in Aviation Maintenance Magazine (Aviation Maintenance / avm-mag.com / April 2013) by Jason Dickstein, an attorney with the Washington Aviation Group, PC (http://www.washingtonaviation.com/).</p>
        <p>(Link to article: The Parts Traceability Puzzle by Attorney Jason Dickstein)</p>
        <p>In the article, the author points out a little-known fact in our industry about the FAA's requirements for aircraft parts traceability: there are none! That's right, the FAA has NO general requirements about parts traceability, and as Dickstein points out, although here are requirements for maintenance records, requirements for delivering a completed aircraft, and requirements for installers regarding what parts can and cannot be installed on an aircraft, "there is no requirement under U.S. law that ANY document follow the aircraft parts from one owner to the next."</p>
        <p>On occasion we have a client that will tell us that we have provided "insufficient traceability" for a part that was purchased, and that "back to birth" traceability is required, or some other "requirement" that they've picked up over the years and adopted as "law." the truth is no such traceability mandate exists; even for life-limited parts, Federal courts have upheld that "current life status" is the only required proof.</p>
        <p>It is because of the misinformation and confusion surrounding Traceability that we have created this page on our site. It is our hope that, by describing our Quality standards, our clients and potential clients will have all of the information they need to make a purchasing decision.</p>
        <p>Ono industry-accepted standard that defines traceability is FAA AC 00-56A (Voluntary Industry Distributor Accreditation Program), and many parts distributors use this standard as the basis of their Quality Management System. It is important to note that this, too, is only a guidance document, not an FAA mandate. In this document, traceability is defined as the "ability to track parts, processes, and materials to the original manufacturer or other acceptable source to meet the requirements of the installer..." (emphasis added).</p>
        <p>The bottom line is that the installer of an aircraft part, not the seller or anyone along the supply chain, has the obligation to make a determination of airworthiness under Part 43 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. Because of this, the installer's requirements drive whether or not the part is acceptable for installation. the truth is that, in the aviation industry, companies that operate, maintain and/or repair aircraft have their own standards and guidance documents that regulate their operations, and the FAA holds them accountable to maintain those standards. Since we cannot be expected to know every client's requirements, we can only commit ourselves to providing traceability information and copies of any and all documentation, upon request, before a purchase is made.</p>
        <p>In summary, we at Zenith Aviation are committed to selling only the highest quality parts at the best possible pricing, but we make no assumption that the part we have for sale complies with the various different requirements for each of our thousands of clients! Likewise, our potential clients should not make these assumptions, either, but should make sure the part we are selling meets (or exceeds) their specific requirements and expectations. We are happy to provide full disclosure about our parts, but we count on our clients to ask the necessary questions about traceability and part conditions specific to their requirements BEFORE THE SALE.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DISCLAIMER & EXPLANATION</p>
        <p>Zenith Aviation is a purchaser of bulk surplus parts (parts that are purchased from companies that close their doors or airlines and corporate operators that retire an aircraft), and as such sometimes the only trace document we can provide is from the company from where we purchased the parts. Inthe case of bulk purchases, Zenith Aviation's Quality system excludes a requirement to trace further than the seller, although many times that company does have copies of trace attached to the part. When further trace is available, we provide those documents to our clients. This said, parts listed for sale by Zenith Aviation have no guarantee at the time of listing, expressed or implied, that trace documentation beyond from where we purchased the part exists. It is the sole responsibility of the BUYER to insure the part they are considering for purchase meets their specific quality and traceability requirements.</p>
